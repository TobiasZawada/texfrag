;;; Commentary:

;; Enable AUCTeX-preview in non-LaTeX modes.
;; Strategy:
;; - collect all header contents and latex fragments from the source buffer
;; - prepare a LaTeX document from this information
;; - let preview do its stuff in the LaTeX document
;; - move the preview overlays from the LaTeX document to the source buffer
;;
;; Install texfrag via Melpa by M-x package-install texfrag.
;;
;; If texfrag is activated for some buffer the image overlays for LaTeX fragments
;; such as equations known from AUCTeX preview can be generated
;; with the commands from the TeX menu (e.g. "Generate previews for document").
;;
;; The major mode of the source buffer should have a
;; texfrag setup function registered in `texfrag-setup-alist'.
;; Thereby, it is sufficient if the major mode is derived
;; from one already registered in `texfrag-setup-alist'.
;;
;; The default prefix-key sequence for texfrag-mode is the same as for preview-mode, i.e., C-c C-p.
;; You can change the default prefix-key sequence by customizing `texfrag-prefix'.
;; If you want to modify the prefix key sequence just for one major mode use
;; `texfrag-set-prefix' in the major mode hook before you run texfrag-mode.
;;
;; You can adapt the LaTeX-header to your needs by buffer-locally setting
;; the variable `texfrag-header-function' to a function without arguments
;; that returns the LaTeX header as a string.  Inspect the definition of
;; `texfrag-header-default' as an example.
;;
;; There are three ways to add TeXfrag support for your new major mode.
;;
;;  1. Derive your major mode from one of the already supported major modes
;;     (see doc of variable `texfrag-setup-alist').
;;     You do not need to do anything beyond that if your major mode does not
;;     change the marks for LaTeX equations (e.g., "\f$...\f$" for LaTeX equations
;;     in doxygen comments for `prog-mode').
;;
;;  2. Add a setup function to `texfrag-setup-alist' (see the doc for that variable).
;;     The minor mode function `texfrag-mode' calls that setup function
;;     if it detects that your major mode out of all major modes
;;     registered in `texfrag-setup-alist' has the closest relationship
;;     to the major mode of the current buffer.
;;     The setup function should adapt the values of the buffer local special variables
;;     of texfrag to the needs of the major mode.
;;     In many cases it is sufficient to set `texfrag-comments-only' to nil
;;     and `texfrag-frag-alist' to the equation syntax appropriate for the major mode.
;;
;;  3. Sometimes it is necessary to call `texfrag-mode' without corresponding
;;     setup function.  For an instance editing annotations with `pdf-annot-edit-contents-mouse'
;;     gives you a buffer in `text-mode' and the minor mode `pdf-annot-edit-contents-minor-mode'
;;     determines the equation syntax.
;;     One should propably not setup such general major modes like `text-mode' for texfrag.  Thus, it is
;;     better to call `TeXfrag-mode' in the hook of `pdf-annot-edit-contents-minor-mode'.
;;     Note, that the initial contents is not yet inserted when `pdf-annot-edit-contents-minor-mode' becomes active.
;;     Therefore, one needs to call `texfrag-region' in an advice of `pdf-annot-edit-contents-noselect'
;;     to render formulas in the initial contents.
;;     Further note, that there is already a working version for equation preview in pdf-tools annotations.
;;     Pityingly, that version is not ready for public release.
;;
;; The easiest way to adapt the LaTeX fragment syntax of some major mode
;; is to set `texfrag-frag-alist' in the mode hook of that major mode.
;; For `org-mode' the function `texfrag-org'
;; can be used as minimal implementation of such a hook function.
;; Note that this function only handles the most primitive
;; syntax for LaTeX fragments in org-mode buffers, i.e., $...$ and \[\].
;;
;; For more complicated cases you can install your own
;; parsers of LaTeX fragments in the variable
;; `texfrag-next-frag-function' (see the documentation of that variable).
;;

;;; Requirements:
;; - depends on Emacs "25" (because of when-let)
;; - requires AUCTeX with preview.el.

;;; Important changes
;; Here we list changes that may have an impact on the user configuration.
;;
;; 2018-03-05:
;; - `texfrag-header-function' is now called with `texfrag-source-buffer' as current buffer.
;; - adopted LaTeX header generation from `org-latex-make-preamble'
;;
;; 2019-05-04:
;; - `texfrag-region' for `texfrag-preview-buffer-at-start' has been moved to `post-command-hook'
;;   That is an important step to make `texfrag-preview-buffer-at-start' really work.
;;   (No repeated LaTeX processing on the same document within one command.)
;; - This version of texfrag is tagged 1.0.
;;
;; 2019-11-29:
;; - Let TeXfrag scale the images according to `text-scale-mode'.
;; - That is actually like a bugfix for `preview.el'.  In the original version of preview
;;   the function registered at `preview-scale-function' is run in the TeX process buffer and not in
;;   the associated LaTeX source buffer.  The newly registered function `texfrag-scale-from-face'
;;   switches to `TeX-command-buffer' (which is actually the source buffer) before it
;;   calculates the scaling factor.  In that way the settings in the source buffer are taken into account.
;;   Added the scaling factor `texfrag-scale'.  You can use that factor to scale all preview images up.

The default works for some LaTeX fragments in doxygen.

The value is a list of equation-filters.
Each equation-filter is a list of two matchers, two replacement strings, and further property-value pairs.
The first matcher can be a regular expression string matching the beginning of a formula
or a list with the regular expression string as its first element and a function
as its second element. The function returns non-nil if the match really starts a LaTeX fragment.
The second matcher can only be regular expression.

The regular expressions of the first two matchers match the beginning and the end of an equation in the original buffer.
The last two strings are the beginning and the end of the corresponding equation in the LaTeX buffer.
They have the format of the NEWTEXT argument of `replace-match'.
You need to escape the backslash character ?\\\\ and you can refer to groups as explained further below.

Capturing groups can be used in the first two regular expressions. These groups can be referred to in the last two replacement strings.
The indexes for the captures are determined as match for the combined regular expression
\\(beginning regexp\\)\\(end regexp\\).

Following properties are recognized:

:display (default: nil) if the :display property is non-nil fragments are wrapped
into newlines by `texfrag-fix-display-math'.

:generator (default: nil)
May be nil or a generator function to be called with the transformed match as argument.
The generator should return the image or a file name to the image to be displayed.

:filter (default: nil)
May be nil or a filter function to be called with the original match as argument.
Returns the transformed match to be inserted in the auxiliary LaTeX file

:begin-group-number (default: 0)
:end-group-number (default: 0)
Number of the regexp group in the begin regexp and the end regexp, respectively,
that really delimit the begin marker and the end marker in the source file.
